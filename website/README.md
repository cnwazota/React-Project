# Five major advantages of React

* Itâ€™s Fast, Simple, and Easy to Use
* React Components Ease Debugging
* React makes it possible for developers to implement interactive UI elements into HTML, PHP, Javascript, and other code layouts in a scalable fashion
* React Applications are Declarative
* JSX and Virtual DOM Boost User Experiences

# Question 4:
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It was created by Jordan Walke and it is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

# 3 Notable differences between HTML and JSX
* In JSX you must return a single parent element, in HTML you don't have to return a single parent element
* JavaScript can be implemented directly in JSX by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {}, in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript
* To define inline styles for JSX, you write it as an object, with the properties in camelCase, the values in quotes, and then you pass it inline to the JSX. In HTML, you're free to define millions of styles right inside the opening tag without writing them as objects and putting them in quotes. 

# Why can't browsers read JSX? 
Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it.
